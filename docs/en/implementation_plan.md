# 2026-03-04 v1.5.13 - Tauri Bridge-First Implementation Plan Update

## English Document

### Scope Alignment

This update aligns the implementation plan with the current Electron-to-Tauri migration strategy:

- Tauri as the primary desktop shell.
- Godot as the Path Mode interactive surface.
- Node sidecar as the graph build and runtime service.
- Bridge-first message flow (`Godot <-> PathBridge <-> Backend`) as the default path.

### Completed in Current Migration Cycle

- Runtime path unification for sidecar execution and frontend asset resolution has been integrated across desktop runtime paths.
- Worker path resolution has been stabilized for packaged sidecar execution to avoid `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in worker threads.
- Knowledge Base folder loading is now anchored to the configured project root path and no longer depends on Electron-only assumptions.
- The `Path Mode` configuration migration has moved core controls into Godot-side UI while preserving browser toolbar behavior for browser mode.

### Open Gaps and Risk Items

- Cache-exists decision flow still requires strict regression verification in Tauri mini GPU runs to ensure users are prompted to reuse or rebuild.
- Duplicate load cycles must remain guarded to prevent repeated build/restore actions after a single user click.
- WebSocket client lifecycle still needs hardening to avoid redundant early connect/disconnect churn under startup timing races.
- History tracking for center-node switches in Godot requires final behavioral verification.

### Next Execution Steps

1. Lock cache prompt + single-execution semantics with dedicated regression tests.
2. Finalize websocket lifecycle guard rails and startup sequencing.
3. Complete task-level parity checks for Electron IPC replacements and remove remaining implicit Electron dependencies.
4. Keep dual-output mobile strategy: maintain Capacitor output while also enabling Tauri Android build path.
